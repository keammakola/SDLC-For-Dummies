# SDLC for dummies

Welcome to **SDLC for dummies**. This repository provides a comprehensive technical and visual blueprint for managing the entire lifecycle of a software project, from the initial spark of an idea to its eventual retirement.

## Overview

Modern software development requires more than just writing code. It demands alignment, rigorous testing, scalable architecture, and a plan for long-term health. This framework breaks down the process into 8 distinct phases, each with its own goals, core tasks, and key deliverables.

## Framework Phases

Click on any phase to explore the detailed documentation and deliverables:

### 1. **[Phase 1: Discovery and Definition](Phase%201:%20Discovery%20and%20Definition.md)**
*   **Goal:** Align on the problem being solved.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    *   Stakeholder and market research
    *   Feasibility analysis (Tech, Financial, Operational)
    *   Success metrics and Vision development
*   **Key Deliverables:** Vision Statement, Project Charter

### 2. **[Phase 2: Requirements Analysis](Phase%202:%20Requirements%20Analysis.md)**
*   **Goal:** Define exactly what the system must do.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    *   Define functional requirements (features and user workflows)
    *   Define non-functional requirements (security, scalability, performance)
    *   Risk assessment and prioritization (MoSCoW)
*   **Key Deliverables:** Software Requirements Specification (SRS), Product Backlog

### 3. **[Phase 3: Architecture and Design](Phase%203:%20Architecture%20and%20Design.md)**
*   **Goal:** Create the technical and visual blueprint.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    *   System architecture and tech stack selection
    *   UI/UX design (wireframes and mockups)
    *   Data modeling and API design
*   **Key Deliverables:** Architecture Design Document, UI Mockups

### 4. **[Phase 4: Development](Phase%204:%20Development.md)**
*   **Goal:** Build the software to pass the pre-written tests.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    *   Clean code implementation and API development
    *   Unit testing and TDD
    *   Peer code reviews and Continuous Integration (CI)
*   **Key Deliverables:** Tested, Functional Codebase

### 5. **[Phase 5: Quality Assurance](Phase%205:%20Quality%20Assurance.md)**
*   **Goal:** Ensure the software meets all requirements and is ready for production.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    *   Functional, Integration, and Regression testing
    *   Performance (Load) and Security testing
    *   User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
*   **Key Deliverables:** Test Reports and UAT Sign-off

### 6. **[Phase 6: Deployment and Release](Phase%206:%20Deployment%20and%20Release.md)**
*   **Goal:** Move the code into the hands of users.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    *   Automate the path to production using CI/CD
    *   Move existing data to the hosting system (self-hosted server, Vercel, etc.)
    *   Set up environment variables and security certificates
*   **Key Deliverables:** Automated CI/CD Pirpelines, Hosted Application

### 7. **[Phase 7: Maintenance and Evolution](Phase%207:%20Maintenance%20and%20Evolution.md)**
*   **Goal:** Keep the software healthy and relevant.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    *   Have monitoring systems in place to track errors, latency, and server health
    *   Address user-reported bugs
    *   Plan for v2.0 based on user data
*   **Key Deliverables:** Performance Logs and Feedback Loops

### 8. **[Phase 8: Decommissioning (End of Life)](Phase%208:%20Decommissioning.md)**
*   **Goal:** Safely retire the system when it is no longer needed.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    *   Data Archival: Securely back up data according to compliance rules.
    *   Transition Management: Migrate users to a successor system.
    *   Infrastructure Teardown: Shut down servers and revoke access permissions.
*   **Key Deliverables:** Final Data Archive, Shutdown Report

## How to Use This Framework

This framework is designed to be adaptable. You can use it as:
- **A Checklist:** Ensure you haven't missed critical steps in your development process.
- **A Template:** Use the suggested "Key Deliverables" in each phase to structure your own project documentation.
- **A Learning Resource:** Understand the dependencies between different stages of the SDLC.
