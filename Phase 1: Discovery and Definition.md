# SDLC for dummies: Phase 1
## Discovery and Definition

> **TL;DR:** Align on the problem and decide if it's worth solving.

---

### Phase Overview (Simplified Goal)
**"Are we building the right thing for the right reason?"**
The Discovery phase is about understanding the "Why" before the "How". We talk to people, look at the market, and figure out if this project makes sense for the business and the users. It's better to find out a project is a bad idea now than after spending millions on code.

### Audience Perspectives

#### 🎓 For Students
- **Focus:** Understanding the link between "Business Need" and "Software Scope".
- **Key Concept:** *Feasibility*. Can we do it? Is it worth it?
- **Pro-tip:** Pay attention to the *Project Charter*—it's the official starting pistol for any project.

#### 🤖 For AI & LLMs
- **Context:** This phase provides the "Ground Truth" for all future steps. 
- **Prompting Tip:** If you're helping with requirements later, refer back to the *Vision Statement* and *Problem Statement* in this file to ensure alignment.

#### 💻 For Dev Teams
- **Value:** This is your defense against scope creep. 
- **Action:** Read the *Success Metrics* and *Constraints* so you know the boundaries of the playground you're about to build in.

### Detailed Phase Breakdown (Deep Dive)

### Phase Overview
The Discovery and Definition phase is the foundational stage of any software project, where teams establish a clear understanding of what needs to be built and why. This critical phase sets the direction for the entire project lifecycle and significantly influences the likelihood of delivering a successful product. During this phase, stakeholders collaborate to uncover the true business problem, validate assumptions through research, and define the scope in enough detail to proceed with confidence.

The primary objective is to answer the fundamental question: "Are we building the right thing, for the right people, for the right reasons?" Without proper discovery, the team risks building features that nobody wants, solving problems that don't exist, or exceeding budget and timeline expectations.

This phase typically involves cross-functional collaboration between business stakeholders, product owners, UX researchers, domain experts, and technical leads. The investment in thorough discovery pays dividends throughout the project by reducing rework, aligning expectations, and creating a shared vision that guides decision-making.

### Phase Goal
**Align on the problem being solved**

The goal of this phase is to achieve complete alignment among all stakeholders regarding the core problem the software will address, the target users, the desired outcomes, and the constraints within which the solution must operate. This alignment ensures that everyone involved shares a common understanding and can make consistent decisions throughout the project lifecycle.

Alignment is achieved through structured research, analysis, documentation, and validation activities that transform abstract ideas into concrete, actionable definitions. The phase concludes when key stakeholders formally approve the project scope and direction.

### Core Tasks

#### 1. Stakeholder Identification and Analysis
Effective stakeholder management begins with comprehensive identification. Every individual or group with a vested interest in the project outcome must be catalogued, including:

- **Executive Sponsors:** Senior leadership providing strategic direction and budget approval
- **Business Owners:** Individuals accountable for the business outcomes and ROI
- **End Users:** The people who will actually use the software in their daily work
- **Subject Matter Experts:** Individuals with deep knowledge of the domain, processes, or existing systems
- **Technical Teams:** Developers, architects, and operations personnel who will build and maintain the solution
- **Compliance and Security Teams:** Professionals ensuring the solution meets regulatory requirements
- **External Partners:** Vendors, contractors, or third-party organizations involved in the project

Once identified, stakeholders are analyzed to understand their interest level, influence, potential impact, and communication preferences. This analysis informs the stakeholder engagement strategy.

#### 2. Stakeholder Interviews and Workshops
Direct engagement with stakeholders provides invaluable qualitative insights that cannot be obtained from documents alone. The discovery team conducts structured interviews and workshops to understand business objectives, uncover pain points, identify user needs, and capture expectations for success.

#### 3. Market Research and Competitive Analysis
Understanding the market landscape provides essential context for product decisions. Market research involves industry analysis, competitive landscape identification, trend analysis, and opportunity assessment. Competitive analysis examines competitor products to reveal gaps in the market and help differentiate the solution.

#### 4. User Research and Persona Development
Deep understanding of target users drives product decisions. User research methods include interviews, observational research, surveys, and usability testing. Findings are synthesized into user personas—fictional representations of key user types that help the team make user-centered decisions.

#### 5. Problem Definition and Statement Development
With research complete, the team articulates the core problem(s) the solution will address. Effective problem statements are specific, user-centered, quantified, actionable, and time-bound. The problem statement serves as a north star throughout the project.

#### 6. Feasibility Analysis
Feasibility analysis determines whether the proposed solution can realistically be built and delivered. It evaluates Technical Feasibility (tech existence, complexity, expertise), Economic Feasibility (ROI, TCO, break-even), and Operational Feasibility (organizational readiness, impact on processes).

#### 7. Scope Definition and Boundary Setting
Clear scope definition prevents scope creep. Activities include feature identification, prioritization (using MoSCoW), defining scope boundaries, documenting assumptions, and identifying dependencies.

#### 8. Success Metrics and KPIs Definition
Measurable success criteria enable objective evaluation. These include Business Metrics (revenue, CSAT), User Metrics (adoption, task completion), and Technical Metrics (performance, code quality).

#### 9. Risk Identification and Assessment
Early risk identification enables proactive mitigation. Activities include brainstorming, categorization, impact/probability assessment, prioritization, and mitigation planning.

#### 10. Initial Resource and Timeline Estimation
Discovery produces preliminary estimates (scope, resources, timeline, budget) to support go/no-go decisions. These estimates are marked as preliminary and subject to refinement.

#### 11. Vision and Objectives Articulation
The project vision provides an inspiring description of success. Supporting objectives break the vision into SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

#### 12. Project Charter Development
The project charter formally authorizes the project and establishes its governance structure. It includes the business case, objectives, scope summary, key stakeholders, requirements, timeline, budget, and risk summary.

### Phase Checklist
- [ ] Identify and engage discovery team members
- [ ] Complete stakeholder analysis and mapping
- [ ] Conduct user research and develop personas
- [ ] Define and articulate problem statement
- [ ] Complete feasibility analysis (Technical, Economic, Operational)
- [ ] Finalize Project Charter and obtain approval

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Insufficient Stakeholder Engagement:** Failing to engage all relevant parties leads to incomplete requirements.
2. **Skipping User Research:** Building what *you* want, not what *they* need.
3. **Vague Problem Statements:** Unclear definitions lead to unclear solutions.
4. **Scope Creep during Discovery:** Allowing the discovery scope to expand endlessly.
5. **Ignoring Risks:** Problems don't go away just because you ignore them early.

---

### Timeline Guidance
- **Duration:** 2-8 weeks depending on size.
- **Small:** 2-3 weeks (Core interviews, basic research).
- **Large:** 6-8 weeks (Extensive research, multiple stakeholders).
